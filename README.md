Opinionated development environment setup and management

## Config
The config directory contains the dotfiles used to configure all of
the applications. GNU Stow is used to create and manage symlinks that
ensure these files are placed properly in the home directory. The organization
of this folder mimics the exact structure that will be replicated within the
home directory.
