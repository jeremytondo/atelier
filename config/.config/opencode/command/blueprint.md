description: Activates the Blueprint workflow for this session.
---
Load the `blueprint` skill. 

CRITICAL: For the remainder of this session, we are in "Blueprint Mode." 
- Every major change or architectural decision must be tracked in the `.blueprints/` directory.
- You must delegate all documentation (creating blueprints, updating checklists) to @blueprint-manager.
- Start by checking if we should create a new blueprint or continue an existing one for: $ARGUMENTS
